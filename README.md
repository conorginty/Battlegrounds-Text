# Battlegrounds-Text
A text-based, CLI variant of Hearthstone's popular auto-chess battler: Battlegrounds

Players will look forward to having the same experience offered by Hearthstone Battlegrounds, but in text-based format.

Players can do the following right now:
- Generate a Tavern of 3 random minions
- Purchase Minions
- Play Minions from the Player's Hand to the Board

Some of the effects of Minions have also been encoded (e.g. Battlecries of Murloc Tidehunter and Alleycat)

This Project is currently being built entirely in Java.
